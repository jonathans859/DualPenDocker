# DualPen

A self-hosted, real-time collaborative plaintext editor built to be fully keyboard- and
screen-reader-accessible, so blind and sighted collaborators can edit documents together.

## Features

- Real-time collaborative editing (Yjs CRDT sync over WebSocket), with remote cursor rendering
- Presence sounds (typing on your line, typing elsewhere, peers joining/leaving, and a
  chat-message notification) plus a jump-to-collaborator shortcut (`Alt+J`), designed for
  non-visual awareness of collaborators relative to your own cursor. An always-visible
  "Editing with: ..." list in the editor toolbar shows who else has the document open.
- Persistent per-document chat: `F2` for a quick single-line composer, `Shift+F2` for the
  full panel, plus a paginated REST history endpoint. Server stores the chat history.
- A "who's online" roster (`Alt+W` or the toolbar button) showing everyone connected app-wide and what document they're editing
- Markdown preview (`Alt+R`) — renders the current document's source as sanitized HTML in
  a modal.
- A file tree with full keyboard navigation and standard shortcuts. Move, rename and delete files and folders. Deleting moves an item
  into an auto-created root "Trash" folder. Deleting an empty folder from trash permanently removes it. You can't delete files or non-empty folders, so no chance to lose data through deleting.
- An in-app shortcut reference (`F1` / `Alt+F1`) listing every shortcut across the editor
  and file tree — see [`client/src/shortcuts-help.ts`](client/src/shortcuts-help.ts) for
  the authoritative list.
- Per-user accessibility mode (on by default for new users), editor font/size, and
  presence-sound mute/volume settings, all in one Settings dialog.
- Zip import and export, so you can easily migrate documents to or from DualPen
- Server-wide AES-256-GCM encryption at rest for document content, argon2id-hashed
  passwords, and admin-managed accounts (no self-signup) with list/create/update
  (rename, reset password, toggle admin/active) and deactivate (soft-delete) endpoints,
  plus an in-app Admin dialog (toolbar button, admins only) over those endpoints.
- Request body size cap, zip import limits, and in-process rate limiting (all configurable)
- Optional Redis pub/sub for running multiple backend workers
- Encrypted backup support

## Stack

- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI + Uvicorn), [pycrdt](https://github.com/y-crdt/pycrdt) /
  [pycrdt-websocket](https://github.com/jupyter-server/pycrdt-websocket) for CRDT sync,
  SQLite for metadata (users, tree, chat), filesystem for encrypted document blobs.
- **Frontend:** TypeScript + Vite, [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/),
  [Yjs](https://docs.yjs.dev/) + [y-monaco](https://github.com/yjs/y-monaco) for collaborative editing.

## Local development

Requirements: Python 3.11+, Node 20+.

**Backend:**

```bash
cd server
python -m venv ../.venv
../.venv/bin/activate      # or ..\.venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m server.cli create-admin   # first-run only; prompts (password: 8+ characters)
uvicorn server.app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The session cookie is `Secure` by default. Chrome and Firefox accept it on
`http://localhost`; Safari doesn't, so there set `COLLAB_EDITOR_COOKIE_SECURE=0` before
starting the backend.

Run from the **repository root**, not `server/` — the app is imported as `server.app.main`
and reads/writes `server_data/` relative to the repo root.

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite serves on `http://localhost:5173` (or `5174` if `5173` is taken — both are allowed
by the backend's default CORS config) and talks to the backend at `http://localhost:8000`
automatically; no configuration needed for local dev.

Run the test suite with `python -m pytest` from `server/` (or `server/tests/` — see
`server/pytest.ini`).

## Deploying on your own server

This has not yet been run through a real production deployment, but the pieces needed for
one are in place. The architecture below is the recommended shape; adjust as needed.

### Architecture

One VPS, one process each:

- **uvicorn** runs the FastAPI backend, bound to `127.0.0.1` on some port (`8000` in the
  examples below) — never exposed directly to the internet.
- **nginx** (or another reverse proxy) terminates TLS, serves the built frontend's static
  files directly, and proxies `/api/*` and `/ws/*` to uvicorn. Keeping frontend and backend
  on the same public origin (e.g. `https://editor.example.com/`) is the simplest setup:
  the frontend's API/WebSocket URLs default to same-origin, so no frontend build
  configuration is required in this case.

If you'd rather run the frontend and backend on separate origins (e.g. a static host for
the frontend, a different host/port for the API), see **Split-origin deployment** below —
it needs two extra environment variables and a CORS setting.

### 1. Get the code onto the server

```bash
git clone <your-fork-or-repo-url> collab-editor
cd collab-editor
```

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv

python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r server/requirements.txt
```

`server/requirements.txt` includes the test dependencies (`pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`,
`httpx`) alongside the runtime ones — harmless to install, just some extra disk space if
you'd rather trim it down yourself.

**Runtime data** lives in `server_data/` at the repo root (SQLite database, encrypted
document blobs, and the master encryption key), created automatically on first run. To
point these somewhere else instead (e.g. a separate data volume), set:

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `COLLAB_EDITOR_DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite+aiosqlite:///<repo>/server_data/db/app.db` |
| `COLLAB_EDITOR_DOCSTORE_PATH` | `<repo>/server_data/docstore` |
| `COLLAB_EDITOR_MASTER_KEY_PATH` | `<repo>/server_data/master.key` |
| `COLLAB_EDITOR_BACKUP_PATH` | `<repo>/backups` |

**The master encryption key is generated automatically** the first time anything is
encrypted or decrypted — there's no manual key-generation step. **Back this file up.**
Every document is encrypted at rest with it; if it's lost, encrypted documents on disk
are unrecoverable. It's written with `0600` permissions on Linux.

The SQLite database runs in WAL mode (set automatically on every connection, see
`server/app/db.py`), so reads aren't blocked by concurrent writes — the right default for
several people editing at once. This doesn't replace backups on its own.

**Back up the database, document store, and encryption key together** — a backup of any
one of these three without the other two is useless, since the blobs in `docstore/` are
unreadable without both the database (which maps documents to blob files) and the key
(which decrypts them). Run this manually or from a timer:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m server.cli backup --keep 14
```

This writes a single timestamped `.tar.gz` archive (containing `db/`, `docstore/`, and
`master.key`) into `COLLAB_EDITOR_BACKUP_PATH` (or `--dest` to override per-run), and with
`--keep N` deletes older archives beyond the N most recent. It uses SQLite's online backup
API, so it's safe to run against a live database without stopping the service.

To automate it, add a systemd timer alongside the main service unit below:

`/etc/systemd/system/collab-editor-backup.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Collab Editor backup

[Service]
Type=oneshot
User=collab-editor
WorkingDirectory=/opt/collab-editor
ExecStart=/opt/collab-editor/.venv/bin/python -m server.cli backup --keep 14
```

`/etc/systemd/system/collab-editor-backup.timer`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Daily Collab Editor backup

[Timer]
OnCalendar=daily
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now collab-editor-backup.timer
```

**To restore:** stop the service, extract the archive's `db/app.db`, `docstore/`, and
`master.key` into `server_data/` (overwriting what's there), then restart.

Create the first admin account. Interactive by default (prompts for
username/display name/password):

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m server.cli create-admin
```

For scripted/provisioning use, pass `--username` (plus optional `--display-name`) and
pipe the password in with `--password-stdin`, or set `COLLAB_EDITOR_ADMIN_USERNAME` /
`COLLAB_EDITOR_ADMIN_PASSWORD`:

```bash
printf '%s' "$PW" | .venv/bin/python -m server.cli create-admin --username alice --password-stdin
```

Additional users are managed from the **Admin** button in the app toolbar (visible to
admins only), or directly via the admin API (gated by `is_admin`): `GET /api/admin/users` lists accounts,
`POST /api/admin/users` creates one, `PATCH /api/admin/users/{id}` updates display name,
password, admin flag, or active flag, and `DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}` deactivates an
account (`is_active=false`) rather than hard-deleting it.

### 3. Frontend build

Same-origin deployment (recommended — frontend and API on one domain):

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run build
```

This produces `client/dist/`, a static site with no build-time configuration needed —
it talks to whatever origin it's served from.

### 4. systemd service for the backend

`/etc/systemd/system/collab-editor.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Collab Editor backend
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=collab-editor
WorkingDirectory=/opt/collab-editor
ExecStart=/opt/collab-editor/.venv/bin/uvicorn server.app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --proxy-headers
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Create a dedicated non-root user to own the deployment and its `server_data/` directory
(`sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false collab-editor`, then `chown -R collab-editor:collab-editor
/opt/collab-editor`), then:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now collab-editor
sudo systemctl status collab-editor
```

### 5. nginx

The WebSocket route (`/ws/doc/{doc_id}`) authenticates using the session cookie set by
the regular login flow, so nginx must forward cookies (default behavior) and correctly
proxy the WebSocket upgrade — plain `proxy_pass` does **not** do this on its own.

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name editor.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/editor.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/editor.example.com/privkey.pem;

    root /opt/collab-editor/client/dist;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri /index.html;
    }

    location /api/ {
        client_max_body_size 10m;  # match COLLAB_EDITOR_MAX_BODY_BYTES (nginx default is 1m)
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;  # per-user rate limiting
    }

    location /ws/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_read_timeout 3600s;  # long-lived collaboration sessions
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name editor.example.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

[certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) (`sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx`) is
the easiest way to get the TLS certificate this config references.

### 6. CORS

Only relevant if you're doing a split-origin deployment (see below) or want to allow a
non-default local dev origin. For the same-origin setup above, the default CORS config
(`localhost:5173`/`5174`, for local dev) is simply unused — the browser never sends a
cross-origin request in the first place, so nothing needs changing.

### Split-origin deployment

If the frontend and backend are on different origins:

- **Backend:** set `COLLAB_EDITOR_CORS_ORIGINS` to a comma-separated list of the frontend's
  origin(s), e.g. `COLLAB_EDITOR_CORS_ORIGINS=https://editor.example.com` in the systemd
  unit's `Environment=` line (or an `EnvironmentFile=`).
- **Frontend:** set `VITE_API_BASE` and `VITE_WS_BASE` before running `npm run build`, e.g.:
  ```bash
  VITE_API_BASE=https://api.example.com/api VITE_WS_BASE=wss://api.example.com npm run build
  ```

### Hardening settings

All optional; set in the systemd unit's `Environment=` lines.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `COLLAB_EDITOR_COOKIE_SECURE` | `true` | `Secure` flag on the session cookie. Set `0` only for plain-HTTP local dev. |
| `COLLAB_EDITOR_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | `10485760` | Max HTTP request body (413 beyond). |
| `COLLAB_EDITOR_IMPORT_MAX_ENTRIES` | `5000` | Max entries in an imported zip. |
| `COLLAB_EDITOR_IMPORT_MAX_UNCOMPRESSED_BYTES` | `52428800` | Max total uncompressed import size. |
| `COLLAB_EDITOR_LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT` | `10` | Failed logins per window per IP (429 beyond; `0` disables). Successful logins aren't counted. |
| `COLLAB_EDITOR_ADMIN_RATE_LIMIT` | `120` | `/api/admin/*` requests per window, per signed-in user (unauthenticated requests use a separate per-IP bucket). |
| `COLLAB_EDITOR_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS` | `60` | Rate-limit window. |
| `COLLAB_EDITOR_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` | `true` | Master switch for rate limiting. |
| `COLLAB_EDITOR_REDIS_URL` | unset | Enables multi-process realtime sync/presence/chat via Redis pub/sub. |

### Multiple workers (Redis)

By default rooms live in one process's memory. To run several workers, point
`COLLAB_EDITOR_REDIS_URL` at a Redis instance on a **trusted network** (pub/sub traffic is
unauthenticated beyond what Redis itself enforces) and use a shared docstore volume.

### Remaining caveats

- Passwords must be 8-256 characters (admin API, UI and `create-admin`). Login also rejects
  passwords over 256 characters (422), so an account created earlier with a longer password
  must be reset by an admin.
- Failed logins and malformed login requests (e.g. 422) both count toward the login limit;
  only successful logins are refunded.
- Rate limiting is per process and keyed on the client IP. Behind nginx, run uvicorn with
  `--proxy-headers` (and trusted `--forwarded-allow-ips`) or all users share one bucket.
  A correct login from an IP already locked out by failed attempts still gets 429 until the
  window expires. Limits aren't shared between workers.
- Redis mode: cross-process "one open document per user" closing isn't atomic (two
  simultaneous opens on different processes can close each other); doc state is persisted
  as text, so edits from the last ~2s are lost if every process holding a room crashes; a
  first open waits up to 0.5s for peers; the publish queue is unbounded in memory during a
  long Redis outage, and batches are dropped after retries (state resyncs when Redis
  returns); presence from a hard-killed process lingers ~15s; resync sends full doc state.
  Redis pub/sub is unauthenticated beyond Redis itself, so keep it on a trusted network.
